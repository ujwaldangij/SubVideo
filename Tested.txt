I apologize for any confusion. In Laravel Dusk, there isn't a built-in method called `openNewTab` to open a new tab directly. Instead, you can achieve a similar result by opening a new window using JavaScript. Here's how you can do it:

```php
public function testOpenLinksInNewTab()
{
    $this->browse(function (Browser $browser) {
        // Open the first website
        $browser->visit('https://www.nseindia.com/');

        // Execute JavaScript to open a new tab
        $browser->script("window.open('https://example.com', '_blank');");

        // Switch to the new tab (window)
        $browser->driver->switchTo()->window(end($browser->driver->getWindowHandles()));
        
        // You can now interact with the second tab
        $browser->visit('https://example.com'); // Visit the desired URL in the new tab
        
        // Perform any necessary interactions in the second tab
    });
}
```

In this code, we use JavaScript to open a new tab/window with `window.open`. We then switch to the new tab using `switchTo()` and interact with it by visiting the desired URL. Make sure to replace `'https://example.com'` with the URL you want to open in the new tab.

This approach allows you to open a new tab or window and interact with it in Laravel Dusk.
