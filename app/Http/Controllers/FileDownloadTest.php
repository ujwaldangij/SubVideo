In Laravel Dusk, you can automate the interaction with a download prompt by setting Chrome options using the `using` method on the `DuskTestCase` class. Specifically, you can configure Chrome to automatically download files without displaying a download prompt. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your `DuskTestCase.php` file (usually located in the `tests/Dusk` directory).

2. Import the necessary classes at the top of the file:

   ```php
   use Laravel\Dusk\TestCase as BaseTestCase;
   use Facebook\WebDriver\Chrome\ChromeOptions;
   ```

3. In the `driver` method of your `DuskTestCase` class, configure Chrome to automatically download files:

   ```php
   protected function driver()
   {
       $options = (new ChromeOptions())->addArguments([
           '--disable-extensions',  // Disable extensions (e.g., Chrome extensions that might affect downloads).
           '--disable-notifications', // Disable notifications (e.g., download notifications).
           '--headless', // Run Chrome in headless mode (optional but can be useful for automated tests).
           '--disable-gpu', // Disable GPU (optional but can improve performance).
           '--no-sandbox', // Disable sandboxing (useful in some environments).
           '--disable-software-rasterizer', // Disable software rasterizer (optional but can improve performance).
           '--safebrowsing-disable-download-protection', // Disable download protection (which can show download prompts).
       ]);

       return RemoteWebDriver::create(
           'http://localhost:9515',
           DesiredCapabilities::chrome()->setCapability(ChromeOptions::CAPABILITY, $options)
       );
   }
   ```

   The key argument here is `--safebrowsing-disable-download-protection`, which disables download protection that can show download prompts.

4. Save the changes to your `DuskTestCase.php` file.

With these settings, Chrome will be configured to automatically download files without displaying download prompts during your Laravel Dusk tests. Make sure you're aware of the potential security implications when disabling download protection and use this configuration responsibly, ideally in a controlled testing environment.
