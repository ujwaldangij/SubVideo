To read a CAPTCHA code using Laravel Dusk, you will typically need to use an external service or library to perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the CAPTCHA image. Laravel Dusk itself does not have built-in functionality for reading CAPTCHA codes, as CAPTCHAs are designed to prevent automated scripts from accessing websites.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps you can follow to read a CAPTCHA code using Laravel Dusk:

1. **Capture the CAPTCHA Image:** Use Laravel Dusk to capture the CAPTCHA image. You can do this by taking a screenshot of the element containing the CAPTCHA image on the web page.

2. **Save the Image:** Save the captured CAPTCHA image to a temporary location on your server. You can use Laravel's file handling functions for this.

3. **Perform OCR:** Use an OCR library or service to read the text from the saved CAPTCHA image. Tesseract OCR is a popular open-source OCR engine that can be used for this purpose. You can execute Tesseract OCR from within your Laravel Dusk test by using the `exec` function or a similar method. Make sure to install Tesseract and configure it properly.

   Example using Tesseract OCR in Laravel Dusk:
   ```php
   // Capture and save the CAPTCHA image
   $captchaElement = $browser->element('#captcha-element');
   $captchaImage = $captchaElement->screenshot();

   // Save the image to a temporary location
   $imagePath = storage_path('app/temp/captcha.png');
   $captchaImage->store($imagePath);

   // Perform OCR on the saved image
   $command = "tesseract $imagePath output.txt";
   exec($command);

   // Read the OCR output from the file
   $capturedText = file_get_contents('output.txt');

   // Enter the CAPTCHA text in an input field
   $browser->type('#captcha-input', $capturedText);
   ```

4. **Enter the CAPTCHA Text:** Once you have extracted the text from the CAPTCHA image using OCR, enter it into the appropriate input field on the web page using Laravel Dusk's `type` method.

5. **Submit the Form:** After entering the CAPTCHA text, you can proceed with submitting the form or performing any other actions as required in your test.

Please note that automating the reading of CAPTCHAs can be legally and ethically complex. Make sure you have the necessary permissions and are complying with any applicable laws and terms of service when using CAPTCHA-solving techniques in your automated tests. Additionally, CAPTCHAs are designed to be challenging for automated scripts, so there is no guarantee of 100% accuracy when using OCR.
