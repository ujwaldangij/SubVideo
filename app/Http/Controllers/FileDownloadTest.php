To check if the `rename.zip` file is present in an external directory, unzip it, and put it in the same folder in PHP Laravel, you can use the following code:

```php
use ZipArchive;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;

public function unzipRenameZipFromExternalDirectory()
{
    // Define the external directory path
    $externalFolderPath = '/path/to/external/directory'; // Replace with the actual external directory path

    // Define the name of the zip file to check for
    $zipFileName = 'rename.zip';

    // Check if the zip file exists in the external directory
    $zipFilePath = $externalFolderPath . '/' . $zipFileName;

    if (file_exists($zipFilePath)) {
        // Create a ZipArchive instance
        $zip = new ZipArchive;

        // Open the zip file
        if ($zip->open($zipFilePath) === true) {
            // Define the folder where you want to extract the contents (same folder as the zip file)
            $extractPath = $externalFolderPath;

            // Extract the contents to the extraction directory
            $zip->extractTo($extractPath);
            $zip->close();

            // Optionally, you can perform any additional processing here

            return "File '$zipFileName' extracted successfully!";
        } else {
            return "Failed to open the zip file '$zipFileName'.";
        }
    } else {
        return "File '$zipFileName' not found in the external directory.";
    }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/external/directory` with the actual path to the external directory where the `rename.zip` file is located. This code will check if the zip file exists in the external directory, and if it does, it will extract the contents into the same external directory and provide appropriate feedback based on whether the file is found and successfully extracted.
