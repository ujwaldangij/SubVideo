If you're encountering an "illegal selector was specified" error in Laravel Dusk, it's likely due to a problem with the CSS selector you're using. To resolve this issue, consider the following steps:

1. **Review the Selector:** Double-check the selector you're using to locate the element. Ensure that it accurately matches the element you want to interact with. Pay attention to the structure and attributes of the HTML.

2. **Valid CSS Selector:** Make sure you're using a valid CSS selector. Common CSS selectors include class selectors (e.g., `.classname`), ID selectors (e.g., `#idname`), element selectors (e.g., `div`, `span`), and attribute selectors (e.g., `[data-attribute="value"]`).

3. **Use XPath:** If CSS selectors are not sufficient, consider using XPath expressions to locate the element. XPath provides more powerful ways to select elements in the DOM.

4. **Check for Dynamic Content:** If your page contains dynamic content that may not be available immediately, ensure your Dusk test waits for the content to load. Use the `waitFor` method or other waiting techniques to handle dynamic content.

5. **Debugging:** Add debugging statements to your Dusk test to print out information about the element and the HTML source of the page. This can help you troubleshoot selector issues.

Here's an example using XPath to locate the text "2023" and then click a `span` tag:

```php
$textToFind = '2023';

$browser->driver->findElement(WebDriverBy::xpath("//*[text()='$textToFind']/following-sibling::span"))->click();
```
