You can use PHP and Laravel to check if a file named "readme.zip" is present in a specific folder and delete it if it exists. Here's a basic example:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\File;

$downloadFolderPath = '/path/to/your/download/folder';
$filenameToDelete = 'readme.zip';

// Check if the file exists in the folder
if (File::exists($downloadFolderPath . '/' . $filenameToDelete)) {
    // If it exists, delete it
    File::delete($downloadFolderPath . '/' . $filenameToDelete);
    echo $filenameToDelete . ' has been deleted.';
} else {
    echo $filenameToDelete . ' does not exist in the download folder.';
}
```

Replace `'/path/to/your/download/folder'` with the actual path to your download folder. This code checks if "readme.zip" exists in the specified folder and deletes it if found.
