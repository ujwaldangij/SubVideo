Laravel Dusk test cases are designed to be deterministic and not suitable for indefinite loops like a `while` loop to keep attempting a login until it succeeds. Running tests with indefinite loops can lead to various issues and isn't the intended use of Dusk.

However, you can create a loop within a Dusk test to retry a login for a specified number of times or until a certain condition is met. Here's an example:

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Browser;

use Laravel\Dusk\Browser;
use Tests\DuskTestCase;

class LoginTest extends DuskTestCase
{
    public function testLogin()
    {
        $maxAttempts = 3; // Maximum number of login attempts
        
        $this->browse(function (Browser $browser) use ($maxAttempts) {
            $attempts = 0;

            while ($attempts < $maxAttempts) {
                $browser->visit('/login')
                    ->type('email', 'your@email.com')
                    ->type('password', 'yourpassword')
                    ->press('Login');

                if ($browser->assertSee('Welcome, User!')) {
                    // Login was successful, break out of the loop
                    break;
                }

                // Increment the attempts count and wait before retrying (if needed)
                $attempts++;
                if ($attempts < $maxAttempts) {
                    $browser->pause(1000); // Wait for 1 second before retrying
                }
            }

            // You can continue with other actions or assertions here
            $browser->clickLink('Dashboard')
                ->assertSee('Dashboard'); // Example navigation to the dashboard
        });
    }
}
```

In this example, we use a `while` loop to attempt the login up to a maximum of three times (`$maxAttempts`). If a successful login is detected, the loop is exited with `break`. We also introduce a brief pause between login attempts to avoid excessive requests.

While this approach allows for retrying a login, it's essential to set a reasonable maximum number of attempts (`$maxAttempts`) to prevent infinite loops and to handle login failures gracefully in your test code.

Note: Dusk tests are primarily meant for testing specific functionalities, and the use of indefinite loops should be avoided whenever possible to ensure the reliability and determinism of your tests.
