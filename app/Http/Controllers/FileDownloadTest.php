To check if a file named `rename.zip` is present in a folder and then unzip that file into the same folder in PHP Laravel, you can use the following code:

```php
use ZipArchive;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;

public function unzipRenameZipIfPresent()
{
    // Define the folder containing the zip files
    $folderPath = storage_path('app/your_folder_name'); // Update 'your_folder_name' with your actual folder name

    // Define the name of the zip file to check for
    $zipFileName = 'rename.zip';

    // Check if the zip file exists in the folder
    $zipFilePath = $folderPath . '/' . $zipFileName;

    if (Storage::exists($zipFilePath)) {
        // Create a ZipArchive instance
        $zip = new ZipArchive;

        // Open the zip file
        if ($zip->open(storage_path('app/' . $zipFilePath)) === true) {
            // Define the extraction directory (same folder)
            $extractPath = $folderPath;

            // Extract the contents to the extraction directory
            $zip->extractTo($extractPath);
            $zip->close();

            // Optionally, you can perform any additional processing here

            return "File '$zipFileName' extracted successfully!";
        } else {
            return "Failed to open the zip file '$zipFileName'.";
        }
    } else {
        return "File '$zipFileName' not found in the folder.";
    }
}
```

Replace `'your_folder_name'` with the actual name of the folder where your `rename.zip` file is expected to be located.

This code checks if `rename.zip` exists in the specified folder, and if it does, it extracts the contents into the same folder. It then provides appropriate feedback based on whether the file is found and successfully extracted.
